does sending null in json actually work
does testing for response.rows[0] === undefined work
does not returning a value from a .then result in the next .then not executing
answer: it doesn't 
the solution: 
throw errors from all .then statements that won't allow the next to execute
otherwise test for whether next value is undefined
