this will be a simple social media app.
we will first implement a version with no follows, where everyone's content will be shown in chronological order.
this will have a database.
It should probably be in SQL since later on we can add follows which create relationships. We can try mongoDB later.
We will need a REST API for this.
we will also need to create accounts, and allow people to log in.
this could be done with cookies, but not right now. At the moment, you will be logged out when you close the page.

Users will be able to like posts. They will also be able to dislike posts
Users will be able to sort their feed by number of likes.
A title and some text will be visible in each post.
the author account will be visible in posts
Users will also be able to write posts 

There will be a header bar with a drop-down menu to access features
posts will be displayed in a simple descending slide

maybe later we can add images to posts
we can also add follows later

This might take a while but hopefully it won't be too bad
